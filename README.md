# Comment_toxicity_prediction
In recent years, the proliferation of user-generated content on social media platforms, forums, and comment sections has led to the emergence of harmful or abusive language. This kind of harmful content, often referred to as toxic comments, can have a significant negative impact on online communities and user experiences. Identifying and filtering toxic contentautomatically is a crucial task in ensuring safe and welcoming online environments. This project aims to build a Convolu tional Neural Network (CNN) model for the classification of text comments as either toxic or non-toxic. CNNs, commonly used in image processing tasks, have proven effective in text classification due to their ability to detect spatial hierarchies and patterns in data. By applying CNNs to natural language processing (NLP), we can train a model to automatically categorize comments based on the underlying semantic and syntactic structures of the text. The core objective of this project is to develop a text classification pipeline that: 1.Processes and cleans raw textual data: Removing noise and normalizing text to make it suitable for machine learning. 2.Transforms text data into numerical format: Tokenizing the text and converting it into sequences that can be fed into a neural network. 3. Builds and trains a CNN model: Using the processed data to train a model capable of distinguishing between toxic and non-toxic comments. 4. Evaluates and deploys the model: Assessing model performance on unseen data and enabling real-time predictions for new user inputs. This project demonstrates how machine learning, specif cally deep learning using CNNs, can be applied to tackle the real-world problem of moderating online content. The trained model can be integrated into various platforms to automatically filter harmful content and promote positive interactions.
